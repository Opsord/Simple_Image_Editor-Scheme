# Simple Image Editor (Scheme version)

This code was written following the functional paradigm of programming.

The program allows the manipulation of pre-defined images in several ways via the implementation of Abstract Data Types:

- ADT-Image
- ADT-PixBIT
- ADT-PixHEX
- ADT-PixRGB

In addition to those files, there is a file called "testing-script" with some examples of image manipulation.

Also, is it possible to find a "random-examples" file with different functions that stick to the functional paradigm.
